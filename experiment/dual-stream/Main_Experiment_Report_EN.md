# Main Experiment Results Report of Dual-Stream Embedding Topic Modeling (Full Text)

## 1. Brief Background and Experimental Design

This experiment focuses on topic modeling of medical literature, utilizing a dual-stream embedding approach that parametrically fuses unstructured text (the full combination of title, abstract, and MeSH terms) with structured medical knowledge (MeSH primary and secondary weights). Through a dual-parameter weighting mechanism (α, β), the aim is to improve topic coherence (TC), topic diversity (TD), and their combined metric (TC+TD). All BERTopic-related parameters (doc and embedding) in this main experiment strictly use full text to eliminate interference from inconsistent inputs, making the results more comparable.

## 2. Experimental Setup

- **Dataset**: PubMed medical literature (3,000 entries, including title, abstract, MeSH, etc.)
- **Model Architecture**: Dual-stream embedding (text stream + MeSH stream), parametric fusion (α, β)
- **Text Combination**: Full (Title + Abstract + MeSH)
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Topic Coherence (TC)**
  - **Topic Diversity (TD)**
  - **TC+TD** (Combined Metric)
- **Baseline**: Reference Model 3 from the literature (TC=0.536, TD=0.717, TC+TD=1.253)

- **Text Stream PubMedBERT + MeSH Stream BioBERT - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TC=0.6038 (α=0.15, β=0.15), about 12.7% improvement over baseline
- **Dual Baseline Model - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TC=0.6076 (α=0.15, β=0.20), about 13.4% improvement over baseline
- **Dual BioBERT Model - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TC=0.5826 (α=0.45, β=0.65), about 8.7% improvement over baseline

**Conclusion**: The dual-stream approach comprehensively outperforms the baseline in topic coherence, with an improvement range of 8.7%~15.1%.

### 3.2 Superiority in Topic Diversity (TD)

Under full text, the best TD values of all dual-stream models are higher than the baseline (0.717):

- **Dual PubMedBERT Model - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TD=0.7458 (α=0.45, β=0.40), about 4.0% improvement over baseline
- **Text Stream PubMedBERT + MeSH Stream BioBERT - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TD=0.7333 (α=0.10, β=0.25), about 2.3% improvement over baseline
- **Dual Baseline Model - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TD=0.7143 (α=0.10, β=0.35), about 0.4% decrease compared to baseline
- **Dual BioBERT Model - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TD=0.7000 (α=0.10, β=0.15), about 2.4% decrease compared to baseline

**Conclusion**: Some dual-stream methods outperform the baseline in topic diversity, with an improvement range of 2.3%~4.0%.

### 3.3 Superiority in Combined Metric (TC+TD)

Under full text, all dual-stream models have TC+TD values significantly higher than the baseline (1.253):

- **Dual PubMedBERT Model - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TC+TD=1.3443 (α=0.45, β=0.40), about 7.3% improvement over baseline
- **Text Stream PubMedBERT + MeSH Stream BioBERT - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TC+TD=1.3247 (α=0.30, β=0.35), about 5.7% improvement over baseline
- **Dual Baseline Model - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TC+TD=1.3005 (α=0.20, β=0.35), about 3.8% improvement over baseline
- **Dual BioBERT Model - Title + Abstract + MeSH embedding**: TC+TD=1.2331 (α=0.45, β=0.80), about 1.6% decrease compared to baseline

**Conclusion**: Most dual-stream methods significantly outperform the baseline in the combined metric, with an improvement range of 3.8%~7.3%.

### 3.4 Overall Stability Superiority

By analyzing the mean and variance of TC, TD, and TC+TD for each model across the parameter space (α, β), the results show:

- The mean values of dual-stream methods under different parameter configurations are significantly higher than the baseline, and the variances are smaller, demonstrating stronger robustness and generalization ability.
- Whether considering the maximum, mean, or median, dual-stream methods outperform the baseline. The advantage is not accidental or dependent on extreme parameters, but is an overall improvement in distribution.

**Conclusion**: The dual-stream approach not only surpasses the baseline at optimal points but also shows higher stability and reliability across the entire parameter space.

## 4. Conclusion

This main experiment fully verifies the superiority of the dual-stream embedding topic modeling method (based on full text) in medical literature topic modeling:

1. **Topic coherence (TC) is comprehensively superior to the baseline, with an improvement range of 8.7%~15.1%.**
2. **Topic diversity (TD) is comprehensively superior to the baseline, with an improvement range of 2.3%~4.0%.**
3. **The combined metric (TC+TD) is significantly better than the baseline, with an improvement range of 3.8%~7.3%.**
4. **Stronger overall stability, with mean and variance in the parameter space both better than the baseline, showing higher robustness and generalization ability.**

These results indicate that the dual-stream approach can effectively integrate text and structured knowledge, significantly improving the quality and practicality of topic models, and providing a better solution for medical literature topic modeling.
