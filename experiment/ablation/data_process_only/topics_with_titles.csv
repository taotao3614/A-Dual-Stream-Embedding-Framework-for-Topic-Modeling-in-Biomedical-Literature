BACKGROUND: Stress and anxiety have been identified as significant issues experienced by student nurses during their education. Some studies have suggested that the stress experienced by nursing students is greater than that experienced by medical students, other non-nursing healthcare students, degreed nurses, and the female population in general. A recently introduced energy type therapy, emotional freedom technique (EFT), has shown some success in reducing symptoms of anxiety, stress, and fear in a variety of settings. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of EFT in decreasing anxiety and stress as a potential intervention to assist students in stress management. DESIGN: The study used a mixed method design of both qualitative and quantitative measures. Quantitatively, in a one group pretest-posttest design, participants received group instruction in the technique and were encouraged to repeat it daily. Self-reported anxiety was measured at baseline, and then weekly for four weeks using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The qualitative survey was completed by participants at the end of the study in order to capture a more subjective experience. SETTING: The pilot study was conducted in a two-year college in the southeastern region of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All enrolled nursing students in an associate degree nursing program were invited to participate. Participation was voluntary, resulting in an original convenience sample of thirty-nine nursing students (N=39). METHODS: Data collection instruments included a demographic questionnaire, pretest State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). A qualitative questionnaire was also administered at the end of the four weeks. STAI and PSS were administered weekly. Data analysis using RMANOVA was performed at the second, third and the fourth week. RESULTS: Decreases in anxiety as measured on both the STAI and PSS were statistically significant (p=.05). For PSS, STAI state and trait data, the reduction in self-reported stress was statistically significant with a mean difference baseline to week 4. Qualitative data suggested that nursing students experienced a decrease in feelings of stress and anxiety including a decrease in somatic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings suggested that EFT can be an effective tool for stress management and anxiety relief in nursing students.', ""The role of demographic and psychosocial factors in academic achievement: insights from a cross-sectional study on physiotherapy and rehabilitation students. BACKGROUND: Academic success is a multifaceted outcome influenced by various demographic and psychosocial factors. Understanding these determinants is essential for developing effective interventions, particularly in demanding disciplines such as physiotherapy and rehabilitation. This cross-sectional study examined the relationship between academic performance and demographic and psychosocial variables among undergraduate physiotherapy students. METHODS: Data on students' age, gender, years of education, relationship status, parental status, monthly income, and residence status were collected. Academic success was assessed using grade point average (GPA). Psychosocial variables were measured using validated Turkish versions of the following scales: Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale for self-esteem, Empathy Assessment Scale for empathy, Social Emotional Competence Questionnaire for social and emotional competence, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale for mental well-being, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory for anxiety, UCLA Loneliness Scale Short Form for loneliness, Adult Motivation Scale for motivation, and Satisfaction with Life Scale for life satisfaction. Statistical analyses, including Pearson and Spearman correlations, multiple linear regression, and independent t-tests, were conducted using SPSS 25.0. RESULTS: A total of 256 students (female/male = 187/69) participated in the study. Significant relationships were observed between GPA and gender, monthly income, anxiety levels, and loneliness levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed that 44.0% of the variance in GPA was explained by anxiety (R(2)=0.31, p < 0.001), loneliness (R(2)=0.11, p < 0.001), and gender (R(2)=0.02, p = 0.002). Female students outperformed their male counterparts in academic success (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the significant influence of demographic and psychosocial factors on the academic performance of physiotherapy students. Interventions aimed at reducing financial stress, anxiety, and loneliness may improve academic outcomes. Future research should explore these factors in diverse educational settings and over time to better support student success in healthcare education.

BACKGROUND: Factors associated with depression of medical students are poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of depression in medical students, its change during the course, if depression persists for affected students, what are the factors associated with depression and how these factors change over time. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal observational study was conducted at the Medical School of the University of Minho, Portugal, between academic years 2009-2010 to 2012-2013. We included students who maintained their participation by annually completing a questionnaire including Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Anxiety and burnout were assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and Maslach Burnout Inventory. Surveys on socio-demographic variables were applied to evaluate potential predictors, personal and academic characteristics and perceived difficulties. ANOVA with multiple comparisons were used to compare means of BDI score. The medical students were organized into subgroups by K-means cluster analyses. ANOVA mixed-design repeated measurement was performed to assess a possible interaction between variables associated with depression. RESULTS: The response rate was 84, 92, 88 and 81% for academic years 2009-2010, 2010-2011,2011-2012 and 2012/2013, respectively. Two hundred thirty-eight medical students were evaluated longitudinally. For depression the prevalence ranged from 21.5 to 12.7% (academic years 2009/2010 and 2012/2013). BDI scores decreased during medical school. 19.7% of students recorded sustained high BDI over time. These students had high levels of trait-anxiety and choose medicine for anticipated income and prestige, reported more relationship issues, cynicism, and decreased satisfaction with social activities. Students with high BDI scores at initial evaluation with low levels of trait-anxiety and a primary interest in medicine as a career tended to improve their mood and reported reduced burnout, low perceived learning problems and increased satisfaction with social activities at last evaluation. No difference was detected between men and women in the median BDI score over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that personal factors (anxiety traits, medicine choice factors, relationship patterns and academic burnout) are relevant for persistence of high levels of BDI during medical training. Medical schools need to identity students who experience depression and support then, as early as possible, particularly when depression has been present over time.']",

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Residents work in emotionally demanding environments with multiple stressors. The risk for burnout is high in them and it has significant negative consequences for their career. Burnout is also associated with consequences in terms of physical and mental health including insomnia, cardiovascular disease, depression and suicidal ideation. Thus, the study aimed to study the prevalence of burn out and its correlates among interns and residents at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Cross Sectional Study at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. METHODS: It was a cross Sectional study of 558 interns and residents of Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. Data was collected which included the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory [CBI]which assesses burnout in the dimensions of Personal burnout, Work burnout and Patient related burnout, with a cut off score of 50 for each dimension. Age, sex, year of study, department the resident belonged to, or an intern, junior resident or a super speciality senior resident (resident doing super speciality course after their post graduate masters degree) were the correlates assessed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Univariate analysis. RESULTS: More than one third of the participants were found to have burnout in one or another dimension of the CBI. Burnout was found to be the highest among the interns in the domains of personal burnout (64.05 %) and patient related burnout (68.62 %) and in junior residents for work related burnout (40%). Super specialty senior residents had the least prevalence of burnout in all three dimensions. Among the residents, Non Medical/Non Surgical residents had the least prevalence of burnout in all three dimensions, whereas surgical speciality residents had the highest of personal burnout (57.92 %) and Medical speciality residents had the highest patient related burnout (27.13%). Both medical and surgical specialty residents had equal prevalence of work burnout. The study also showed that as the number of years of residency increased, the burnout also increased in all three dimensions. A between gender difference in burnout was not noticed in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout was found to be present in a large number of residents in our study. Nationwide studies and assessment of more correlates will be needed to understand this phenomenon and also for formulating measures for preventing and managing it.', ""Epidemiology of Burnout and Its Association with Academic Performance Among Medical Students at Hail University, Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: Burnout syndrome is a condition that is well-documented globally among medical students and affects their academic performance due to high levels of associated stress and psychiatric morbidities. This study aimed to assess burnout prevalence and predictors along with its association with academic performance among medical students at Hail University, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey of medical students was conducted between May and June 2019 at the Medical College at Hail University. The English version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)-Student Survey was used to assess the three components of burnout syndrome-cynicism, emotional exhaustion and professional efficacy. A fixed-model multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted for each of the three MBI components' levels and for total burnout to identify factors significantly associated with burnout syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 218 students were included in this study (response rate: 53.8%). The majority of participants were female (n = 121; 55.5%) medical students ranging between 21-24 years of age. High emotional exhaustion, high cynicism and low professional efficacy was found among 79.4%, 61.0%, and 37.6%, respectively, of respondents. The overall prevalence of high burnout was 27.1% (n = 59). Female students were at almost double the risk for high emotional exhaustion compared to male students (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-4.34; P = 0.034). Students with grade point averages (GPA; on a four-point scale) ranging between 3.51-4.0 were considerably less prone (83% less risk) to experience burnout as compared to students with a GPA </=2.0 (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.03-0.91, P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: High levels of overall burnout were reported among Hail University medical students. Students with a higher GPA, however, were found to be less prone to burnout."", 'A One-Year Institutional View of Resident Physician Burnout. OBJECTIVES: This prospective study explores the prevalence, associated characteristics, and trajectory of burnout over one academic year in a multidisciplinary sample of resident physicians using a relatively new burnout survey instrument. METHODS: All residents from a U.S. academic health center (n = 633) were invited to complete the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) three times, with 4-month time lags between invitations. A total of 281 (44%) provided complete CBI survey responses at least once, and 43 (7%) did at all three times. Descriptive statistics, cross-sectional analyses, correlations, and multivariable linear regression analyses were computed, as well as repeated measures ANOVAs and paired t tests, as appropriate, for each CBI domain (personal, work, patient-related burnout). RESULTS: About half had CBI scores indicating moderate-to-high levels of personal burnout (49-52%) and work-related burnout (45-49%), whereas patient-related burnout was less common (14-24%). However, patient-related burnout increased significantly from the beginning to the end of the year. Regression analyses indicated patient-related burnout was significantly higher for postgraduate year 1-2 residents compared to PGY 4+ residents, but was not significantly different by gender. Personal and work burnout scores were significantly higher for females. Persistently high burnout was observed in only 6% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of resident physicians using the CBI, burnout was prevalent and higher levels of burnout were observed for females on the personal and work burnout domains, while junior residents had higher patient-related burnout. Persistently, high burnout was rare. The CBI demonstrated high reliability, was practical to administer, and produced similar results with existing burnout research.']",A Study on Burnout and Exhaustion Among Residents and Trainees in Medical Residency Programs

BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms as well as suicide-related ideation among Japanese university students during the stay-home order necessitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Japan, and offer evidence in support of future intervention to depression and suicide prevention strategies among college and university students. METHODS: The data for this cross-sectional study were derived from the Student Mental Health Survey conducted from May 20 to June 16, 2020 at a national university in Akita prefecture. Among the 5111 students recruited, 2712 participated in this study (response rate, 53%; mean age +/- standard deviation, 20.5 +/-3.5 years; men, 53.8%). Depressive symptoms were identified by using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate depressive symptoms based on a PHQ-9 score >/=10 and suicide-related ideation based on question 9 of PHQ-9 >/=1, which encompasses thoughts of both suicide and self-harm, was 11.7% and 6.7%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that risk factors for depression included being a woman, smoking, alcohol consumption, and social network communication using either video or voice. For suicide-related ideation, alcohol consumption was the only risk factor. Exercise and having someone to consult about worries were associated with decreased risk of both depressive symptoms and suicide-related ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Negative lifestyles of smoking and drinking, and being a woman, may be important risk factors for depressive symptoms, whereas exercise and having someone to consult about worries may be protective factors.', 'Depression and suicide ideation among students accessing campus health care. Depression and suicide are of increasing concern on college campuses. This article presents data from the College Health Intervention Projects on the frequency of depression and suicide ideation among 1,622 college students who accessed primary care services in 4 university clinics in the Midwest, Northwest, and Canada. Students completed the Beck Depression Inventory and other measures related to exercise patterns, alcohol use, sensation seeking, and violence. The frequency of depression was similar for men (25%) and women (26%). Thought of suicide was higher for men (13%) than women (10%). Tobacco use, emotional abuse, and unwanted sexual encounters were all associated with screening positive for depression. ""Days of exercise per week"" was inversely associated with screening positive for depression. Because the majority of students access campus-based student health centers, medical providers can serve a key role in early identification and intervention. With every 4th student reporting symptoms of depression and every 10th student having suicidal thoughts, such interventions are needed.', 'Prevalence and related risk factors of anxiety and depression among Chinese college freshmen. Anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation are becoming the most common mental health problems affecting Chinese college students. The present study investigated the prevalence of mental health problems and their predictors in a sample of 1048 Chinese college freshmen from Shanghai. We used following brief screening instruments to measure symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as self-control and suicidal ideation: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), a mental health and mental health knowledge questionnaire (MK), a mental disease-related attitude questionnaire (MA), questionnaires about the knowledge of psychological services and utilities, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Suicide module, the Self-Rated Health Measurement Scale (SFHMS), the Self-Esteem Scale (SES), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCQ), and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10). Over half of the students suffered from at least one mental health problem. Approximately 65.55% of freshmen had depression, and 46.85% had anxiety. Minority status, low family income, and religious belief were significantly associated with current mental health problems. These findings indicate that mental disorders are highly prevalent among the freshman student population. The prevalence of such mental disorders was greater than that of the general population, and the majority of students with mental health problems require treatment.']",Suicidal and depressive outcomes among students: Analyzing data by gender and self-disorders

BACKGROUND: Depression is an important contributor to the global burden disease that affects people of communities all over the world. With high level of demands in academics and psychosocial pressure, medical students during their course of training tend to become depressed, leading to problems later in professional life and compromising patient care. In Cameroon, there is lack of data on the prevalence of depression and its impact on medical students. To determine the prevalence and predisposing factors associated with depression among medical students in Cameroon (preclinical and clinical). We also evaluated the impact of depression on self-reported academic performance. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out in all 4 state medical schools in 4 different regions from December 2015 to January 2016. Diagnosis of depression, major depression and its associated factors were assessed using the 9-Item-Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a structured questionnaire respectively. We included 618 medical students (response rate: 90.4%). RESULTS: About a third of them (30.6%, 95% CI: 22.8-36.7) were found to have major depressive disorder (PHQ Score >/= 10). With regards to the severity of depression, 214 (34.6%), 163 (26.4%), 21 (3.4%), and 5 (0.80%) students were classified as having mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression respectively. The presence of a chronic disease (OR: 3.70, 95% CI: 1.72-7.94, p = 0.001), major life events (OR: 2.17, 95%CI: 1.32-3.58, P = 0.002), female gender (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.06-2.37, p = 0.024) and being a student at the clinical level (OR: 4.26, 95% CI: 2.71-6.71, p < 0.001) were independently associated with depression. There was no association between depression and self-reported academic performance, (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.9-1.7, p = 0.080). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of major depressive disorders among medical students in Cameroon is high and is associated with the presence chronic disease, major life events, female gender and being a student at the clinical level. So we recommend clinicians attending to medical students with demographic features suggestive of greater risk of depression, to make an in depth investigation on the possible presence of depression. Despite this high prevalence of major depression among medical students, it was not associated with self-reported academic performance.', ""Factors Associated with Depression and Anxiety Symptoms Among Medical Students in Bahrain. OBJECTIVES: Medical training can be a stressful experience and may negatively impact mental health for some students. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among medical students in one international medical university in the Kingdom of Bahrain and to determine associations between these symptoms, the students' characteristics, and their satisfaction with life. METHODS: This is a cross sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire, distributed to 350 enrolled medical students. We used Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI) instruments to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) was used to measure global cognitive judgments of one's life satisfaction. Sociodemographic details including social background and academic information were also documented. RESULTS: Forty percent (n = 124) of the participants had depressive symptoms, of which 18.9% (n = 58) met the criteria for mild, 13% (n = 40) for moderate, and 8.5% (n = 26) for severe depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were associated with Arab ethnicity (chi (2) = 5.66, p = .017), female gender (chi (2) = 3.97, p = .046), relationship with peers (p < .001), year of study (chi (2) = 13.68, p = .008), and academic performance (p < 0.001).

Anxiety symptoms were associated with female gender (chi (2) = 11.35, p < 0.001), year of study (chi (2) = 10.28, p = .036), and academic performance (chi (2) = 14.97, p = .002). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among medical students was high. Medical universities in the Middle East may need to allocate more resources into monitoring and early detection of medical student distress.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in Portuguese medical students compared to students of other faculties, and the possible impact those symptoms have on academic performance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 750 students: 512 medical students and 238 nonmedical students. All students anonymously completed a socio-demographic survey and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation coefficient or Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: We found a prevalence of 21.5% (n = 161) for anxiety symptoms and 3.7% (n = 28) for depressive symptoms. Being a medical student was more significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety (p = 0.034) compared with other students. Depressive symptoms were slightly associated with poor academic performance (p < 0.01). A percentage of 59.6% (n = 96) of students with anxiety symptoms and 46.4% (n = 13) of students with depressive symptoms did not seek medical or psychological care at that time. DISCUSSION: Medical students in this sample seem to have more symptoms of anxiety, possibly explained by a higher number of female students in that sample. Depressive symptoms could be associated with poor academic performance in both groups, but an evident correlation was not established. CONCLUSION: Considering the high levels of anxiety symptoms, the possible impact of depressive symptoms in academic performance and the lack of psychiatric or psychological follow-up reported in this study, it is urgent to develop adequate means of support to improve students' well-being and mental health.""]",Investigating depressive symptoms and stress factors among students using psychometric questionnaires

OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have established a link between the COVID-19 pandemic and poor mental health. They further suggest that young adults may be especially vulnerable to worsened mental health during the pandemic, but few studies have investigated which specific aspects of the COVID-19 experience affect psychological well-being over time. To better understand concrete predictors of poor mental health outcomes in this population, we identified several pandemic-related experiences and evaluated their effects on mental health symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol, and substance use) in a sample of U.S. college students (N = 176). METHODS: Both mental health symptoms and pandemic-related experiences were evaluated at the start of quarantine (March/April 2020, Time 1) and the end of the Spring 2020 semester (May 2020, Time 2). Given the limited literature on specific predictors of mental health during a pandemic, we used elastic net regression, a novel analytic method that helps with variable selection when theoretical background is limited, to narrow our field of possible predictors. RESULTS: While mental health symptoms were elevated at both timepoints, there were no clinically significant changes from Time 1 to Time 2 and few differences between sociodemographic groups. Both disruption due to the pandemic (beta = .25, p = .021) and limited confidence in the federal government's response (beta = -.14, p = .038) were significant predictors of depression symptoms at the end of the semester, even when controlling for baseline depression. Further, predictions that the pandemic would continue to impact daily life further into the future were linked with pandemic stress response symptoms (beta = .15, p = .032) at Time 2, beyond the effects of baseline symptoms. Alcohol (beta = -.22, p = .024) and substance use (beta = -.26, p = .01) were associated with reduced adherence to COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that specific aspects of the pandemic experience may be influencing internalizing symptoms and alcohol/substance use in college students, pointing to potential avenues for targeted support and intervention. PRACTITIONER POINTS: A range of factors may influence university student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students who expect the pandemic will continue to impact daily life further into the future maybe more likely to report stress symptoms. Disruption due to the pandemic and limited confidence in the federal government's response may be associated with depression symptoms. Alcohol and substance use are associated with lower COVID-19 guideline adherence in university students."", 'Risk perceptions, fear, depression, anxiety, stress and coping among Saudi nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted various aspects of the society on a global scale. Schools and universities provide rich resources for adolescents and young adults to develop significant coping mechanisms. AIM: This study assessed the perceptions of risk, fear, mental health status, and coping strategies among Saudi student nurses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using an online survey, the mental health of the students was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale short form version, whereas the coping was assessed by the Brief-Coping Orientation of Problem Experienced scale. RESULTS: The students had modest risk perception and fear of contracting COVID-19. ""Religion"" was reported as the most frequently used coping strategy. Approximately 43.3%, 37.2%, and 30.9% of the respondents manifested some degree of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Poor COVID-19 knowledge, perceived seriousness of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, and the use of some coping strategies were predictors of fear. Knowing someone infected with COVID-19, fear, and several coping strategies predicted students\' mental health.

INTRODUCTION: Public concern for the mental health of university students has been rising over recent years. Newly arising stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could contribute to further mental health burden for students. This study aimed to understand the mental health status of university students at an early stage in the pandemic and to identify academic, non-academic, and COVID-19-related predictors of common mental health difficulties at this time. METHODS: This study examined how academic and non-academic predictors relate to common mental health difficulties using a cross-sectional sample of university students (n = 3817). RESULTS: There were high levels of depression and anxiety during the pandemic, with more than 50% experiencing levels above the clinical cut offs. Academic stress, social isolation, intolerance of uncertainty, and more negative attitudes towards remote teaching and learning predicted higher levels of depression and anxiety. University identification predicted lower levels of depression whereas receiving a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of depression. DISCUSSION: This study identified COVID-19-related factors that uniquely contributed to students' distress during the pandemic, over and above social connectivity variables. As COVID-19 factors, such as the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, may have driven an increase in distress levels among students, these findings provide insights that could help universities and policymakers develop targeted interventions to support the mental health and well-being of university students during future crises.""]","Mental Health Symptoms of Anxiety, Depression, and Stress Among Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic"

Background and aims A bio-psycho-social approach has been recommended in multidisciplinary pain clinics, and in Norway patients with severe chronic nonmalignant pain (CNMP, defined as pain that has persisted for more than 3 months) might be treated at a regional multidisciplinary pain center. The specific aims of this study were (1) to describe characteristics of a sample of outpatients referred and accepted for treatment/management to three regional multidisciplinary pain centers in Norway, (2) to examine patient differences between the centers and (3) to study associations between symptom scores (insomnia, fatigue, depression, anxiety) and patient characteristics. Methods Patients, aged 17 years or older with CNMP admitted to and given a date for first consultation at one of three tertiary, multidisciplinary pain centers: St. Olavs Hospital Trondheim University Hospital (STO), Haukeland University Hospital (HUS) and University Hospital of North Norway (UNN), were included in the study. Data on demographics, physical activity, characteristics of pain, previous traumatic events, social network, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ), Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and SF-36v2(R) were retrieved from the local quality registry at each pain center. Results Data from 1563 patients [mean age 42 (SD 15) years and 63% females] were available for analyses. Average years with pain were 9.3 (SD 9.1). Primary education as highest level of education was reported by 20%, being actively working/student/military by 32%, and no physical activity by 31%. Further, 48% reported widespread pain, 61% reported being exposed to serious life event(s), and 77% reported having a close friend to talk to. Non-worker status, no physical activity, lack of social network, reports of being exposed to serious life event(s) and widespread pain were all characteristics repeatedly associated with clinically high symptom scores. No significant differences between the centers were found in the proportions of patients reporting fatigue nor mean levels of insomnia symptoms. However, the proportion of patients reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression was a little lower at UNN compared with STO and HUS. Conclusions Analyses of registry data from three tertiary multidisciplinary pain centers in Norway support previous findings from other registry studies regarding patient characterized: A large proportion being women, many years of pain, low employment rate, low physical activity rate, and a large proportion reporting previous traumatic event(s). Characteristics such as non-work participation, no physical activity, lack of social network, have been exposed to serious life event(s), and chronic widespread pain were all associated with high clinical score levels of insomnia, fatigue, and mental distress. Health related quality of life was low compared to what has been reported for a general population and a range of other patient groups. Implications The findings of this study indicate that physical activity and work participation might be two important factors to address in the rehabilitation of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. Future studies should also explore whether pre consultation self-reported data might give direction to rehabilitation modalities.', ""Anxiety and categorisation effects in student nurses' attitudes towards young and older patients: A dual pathway model. BACKGROUND: Student nurses often have a negative attitude towards older patients due to negative stereotypes, which may explain their reluctance to work in geriatric care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate a dual effect (direct and indirect via anxiety) of patients' age on student nurses' attitudes towards their patients. DESIGN: Quantitative survey study with 2 between-subjects conditions (patient age: young patients vs. older patients; both n's=52). SETTING: Two schools for higher vocational education in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 104 student nurses between the ages of 16-30 in the third or fourth year of their nursing education (Mage=21.58, SD=2.22; 93 women). RESULTS: Attitudes towards older patients were more negative than those towards young patients. Older patients also elicited less anxiety compared to young patients, and anxiety had a weaker relationship with attitudes towards older patients than attitudes towards younger patients. Attitudes towards younger patients, but not towards older patients, were depressed by anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients generate more negative attitudes among student nurses, but can also improve attitudes indirectly by lowering intergroup anxiety. Older people may be therefore be especially suitable as a patient group to receive care from young nurses in training, who can mature in their profession without being anxious over making a wrong impression."", ""Implementation of a clinical pathway in breast cancer patients undergoing breast surgery. PURPOSE: The present study was conducted to develop a clinical pathway for breast cancer patients undergoing breast surgery. We also aimed to determine the effects of this model on the (1) reduction of patient anxiety, (2) satisfaction of the patient, and (3) quality of life. METHODS: The present study was conducted using a quasi-experimental nonequivalent study design. The study was applied to 69 patients diagnosed with breast cancer, who underwent surgical operations. We collected data using a questionnaire form, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Questionnaire for the Evaluation of Patient Satisfaction, and SF-36 Quality of Life Scale. The data were analysed using percentages, the Student's t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-Test, and chi-square tests. RESULTS: This study showed that a comprehensive breast surgery clinical pathway significantly improved the quality of life and patient treatment satisfaction and reduced anxiety, even though it did not affect the hospitalization time. According to the level of state anxiety, there was not a meaningful statistical difference between groups but the anxiety level of the study group was lower than the control group and there was not a statistically meaningful difference between them in the period of pre-discharge. For quality of life, the physical, general health, vitality, social functioning, and emotional subscale averages were higher for the study group. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate that the implementation of a clinical pathway on patients with breast surgery has a positive effect on increasing patient satisfaction, decreasing patient anxiety levels, and improving their quality of life.""]","Patient-centered care for chronic pain, depression, and dementia in geriatric oncology"

BACKGROUND: College students with depressive symptoms tend to engage in more hazardous drinking and experience more alcohol-related consequences to cope with their symptoms. Given the perceived tension reducing effects of alcohol among these students, it is important to explore how protective factors, such as protective behavioral strategies, account for the relationships among depressive symptoms, drinking motives, and alcohol-related outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the mediating role of drinking motives and protective behavioral strategies on the associations that depressive symptoms have with typical weekly alcohol consumption, hazardous drinking, and alcohol-related negative consequences in a sample of college student drinkers. METHODS: Traditional age college students (n = 566, 73% women; 58% White, non-Hispanic) completed measures of depression, drinking motives, protective behavioral strategies, weekly alcohol use, hazardous drinking, and alcohol-related negative consequences. RESULTS: Coping with depression motives and controlled consumption PBS explained the association between depression and weekly alcohol consumption and hazardous drinking whereas coping with depression motives and serious harm reduction PBS explained the depression-negative consequences relationship. Conformity motives and serious harm reduction PBS explained the association between depression and hazardous drinking and alcohol-related negative consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that students with more depressive symptoms would benefit from clinical interventions tailored to address negative reinforcement drinking motives and, by extension, increase student utilization of PBS related to minimizing harm. Clinical and research implications are provided.', 'Social anxiety symptoms and drinking behaviors among college students: the mediating effects of drinking motives. The impact of social anxiety on negative alcohol-related behaviors among college students has been studied extensively. Drinking motives are considered the most proximal indicator of college student drinking behavior. The current study examined the mediating role of drinking motives in the relationship that social anxiety symptoms have with problematic (alcohol consumption, harmful drinking, and negative consequences) and safe (protective behavioral strategies) drinking behaviors. Participants were 532 undergraduates who completed measures of social anxiety, drinking motives, alcohol use, harmful drinking patterns, negative consequences of alcohol use, and protective behavioral strategy use. Our results show that students with higher levels of social anxiety symptoms who were drinking for enhancement motives reported more harmful drinking and negative consequences, and used fewer protective behavioral strategies. Thus, students who were drinking to increase their positive mood were participating in more problematic drinking patterns compared with students reporting fewer social anxiety symptoms. Further, conformity motives partially mediated the relationship between social anxiety symptoms and negative consequences. Thus, students with more symptoms of social anxiety who were drinking in order to be accepted by their peers were more likely than others to experience negative consequences. Clinical and research implications are discussed.', 'E-cigarettes, alcohol use, and mental health: Use and perceptions of e-cigarettes among college students, by alcohol use and mental health status. INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are popular among college students, who display risky alcohol use patterns. However, little is known about patterns of co-use of e-cigarettes and alcohol. Further, relationships between e-cigarette use and mental illness among college students are unclear. METHODS: College student participants (N\u202f=\u202f631) at a northeastern U.S. university were invited via email to participate in a survey about e-cigarettes and alcohol use. Mental health was self-reported diagnosis of psychiatric (depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, anxiety disorder, personality disorder), and substance (alcohol and other drug) use disorders. Current use of e-cigarette, combustible cigarette, and other tobacco products were assessed via self-reported past 30-day use frequency. Alcohol consumption was assessed via number of self-reported standard alcoholic beverages consumed during a typical drinking episode. Participants also reported regarding co-use of alcohol, e-cigarettes and/or combustible cigarettes. Participants were categorized as non-drinkers, moderate drinkers or binge drinkers, and associations between e-cigarette use, drinking patterns and mental health diagnoses were examined. RESULTS: E-cigarette use was associated with drinking alcohol chi(2)\u202f=\u202f18.62, p\u202f<\u202f.001, and binge drinking (vs. moderate drinking) chi(2)\u202f=\u202f12.20, p\u202f<\u202f.001.

CONCLUSIONS: Drinking college students (especially binge drinkers) and those with mental illness may have heightened risks for e-cigarette use. More research is needed to elucidate relationships between risky alcohol and/or nicotine use and mental illness, and to guide appropriate prevention and intervention efforts for vulnerable college students.']",Alcohol and Smoking Motivations and Consequences Among Students: Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Smokers

BACKGROUND: High positive mental health, including the ability to cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, and be able to contribute to one's community, has been associated with various health outcomes. The role of positive mental health is therefore increasingly recognized in national mental health promotion programs and policies. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be a cost-effective way to disseminate positive psychological interventions to the general population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of a fully automated mHealth intervention on positive mental health, and anxiety and depression symptomology among Swedish university students using a randomized controlled trial design. METHODS: A 2-arm, single-blind (researchers), parallel-groups randomized controlled trial with an mHealth positive psychology program intervention group and a relevant online mental health information control group was employed to estimate the effect of the novel intervention. Participants were recruited using digital advertising through student health care centers in Sweden. Inclusion criteria were (1) university students, (2) able to read and understand Swedish, (3) and have access to a mobile phone. Exclusion criteria were high positive mental health, as assessed by the Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF), or high depression and anxiety symptomology, as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome was positive mental health (MHC-SF), and the secondary outcomes were depression and anxiety symptomatology (HADS). The subscales of MHC-SF were also analyzed as exploratory outcomes. Outcomes were measured 3 months after randomization through questionnaires completed on the participants' mobile phones. RESULTS: A total of 654 participants (median age 25 years), including 510 (78.0%) identifying as female, were randomized to either the intervention (n=348) or control group (n=306). At follow-up, positive mental health was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.067, 95% CI 1.024-1.112, P=.002). For both depression and anxiety symptomatology, the intervention group showed significantly lower scores at follow-up compared with the control group (depression: IRR=0.820, 95% CI 0.714-0.942, P=.005; anxiety: IRR=0.899, 95% CI 0.840-0.962, P=.002). Follow-up rates were lower than expected (58.3% for primary outcomes and 52.3% for secondary outcomes); however, attrition analyses did not identify any systematic attrition with respect to baseline variables. CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth intervention was estimated to be superior to usual care in increasing positive mental health among university students. A protective effect of the intervention was also found on depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using an automated mobile phone format to enhance positive mental health, which offers promise for the use of mHealth solutions in public mental health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Emerging adulthood is often associated with mental health problems. About one in three university students report symptoms of depression and anxiety that can negatively affect their developmental trajectory concerning work, intimate relationships, and health. This can interfere with academic performance, as mood and anxiety disorders are key predictors of dropout from higher education. A treatment gap exists, where a considerable proportion of students do not seek help for mood and anxiety symptoms. Offering internet interventions to students with mental health problems could reduce the treatment gap, increase mental health, and improve academic performance. A meta-analysis on internet interventions for university students showed small effects for depression and none for anxiety. Larger trials are recommended to further explore effects of guidance, transdiagnostic approaches, and individual treatment components. METHODS: This study will offer 1200 university students in Sweden participation in a three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a guided or unguided transdiagnostic internet intervention for mild to moderate depression and anxiety, where the waitlist control group accesses the intervention at 6-month follow-up. Students reporting suicidal ideation/behaviors will be excluded and referred to treatment within the existing healthcare system. An embedded study within the trial (SWAT) will assess at week 3 of 8 whether participants in the guided and unguided groups are at higher risk of failing to benefit from treatment. Those at risk will be randomized to an adaptive treatment strategy, or to continue the treatment as originally randomized. Primary outcomes are symptoms of depression and anxiety. Follow-ups will occur at post-treatment and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month post-randomization. Between-group outcome analyses will be reported, and qualitative interviews about treatment experiences are planned. DISCUSSION: This study investigates the effects of a transdiagnostic internet intervention among university students in Sweden, with an adaptive treatment strategy employed during the course of treatment to minimize the risk of treatment failure. The study will contribute knowledge about longitudinal trajectories of mental health and well-being following treatment, taking into account possible gender differences in responsiveness to treatment. With time, effective internet interventions could make treatment for mental health issues more widely accessible to the student group.', 'Effectiveness of a Web-Based Guided Self-help Intervention for Outpatients With a Depressive Disorder: Short-term Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial. BACKGROUND: Research has convincingly demonstrated that symptoms of depression can be reduced through guided Internet-based interventions. However, most of those studies recruited people form the general population. There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness when delivered in routine clinical practice in outpatient clinics. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to study patients with a depressive disorder (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders, fourth edition), as assessed by trained interviewers with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, who registered for treatment at an outpatient mental health clinic. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of guided Internet-based self-help before starting face-to-face treatment. METHODS: We recruited 269 outpatients, aged between 18 and 79 years, from outpatient clinics and randomly allocated them to Internet-based problem solving therapy (n=136), with weekly student support, or to a control condition, who remained on the waitlist with a self-help booklet (control group; n=133). Participants in both conditions were allowed to take up face-to-face treatment at the outpatient clinics afterward. We measured the primary outcome, depressive symptoms, by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Secondary outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale (HADS-A), Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire (ISI), and EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS). All outcomes were assessed by telephone at posttest (8 weeks after baseline). RESULTS: Posttest measures were completed by 184 (68.4%) participants. We found a moderate to large within-group effect size for both the intervention (d=0.75) and the control (d=0.69) group. However, the between-group effect size was very small (d=0.07), and regression analysis on posttreatment CES-D scores revealed no significant differences between the groups (b=1.134, 95% CI -2.495 to 4.763). The per-protocol analysis (>/=4 sessions completed) results were also not significant (b=1.154, 95% CI -1.978 to 7.637). Between-group differences were small and not significant for all secondary outcomes. Adherence to the intervention was low. Only 36% (49/136) received an adequate dosage of the intervention (>/=4 of 5 sessions). The overall treatment satisfaction was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based problem solving therapy is not more effective in reducing symptoms of depression than receiving an unguided self-help book during the waitlist period at outpatient mental health clinics. The effect sizes are much smaller than those found in earlier research in the general population, and the low rates of adherence indicate that the acceptability of the intervention at this stage of treatment for depressed outpatients is low. However, taking into account that there is much evidence for the efficacy of Internet-based treatments, it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of these treatments in outpatient clinics as a whole.

BACKGROUND: The use of clinical simulation in undergraduate nursing programs in Taiwan has gradually increased over the past 5years. Previous research has shown that students' experience of anxiety during simulated laboratory sessions influences their self-reflection and learning effectiveness. Thus, further study that tracks what influences students' clinical performance in actual clinical sites is vital. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to develop an integrated model that considers the associations among anxiety, self-reflection, and learning effectiveness and to understand how this model applies to student nurses' clinical performance while on clinical placement. DESIGN: This study used a correlational and longitudinal study design. METHODS: The 80 nursing students, who ranged in age from 19 to 21 (mean=20.38, SD=0.56), were recruited from a nursing school in southern Taiwan. Data were collected during three phases of implementation using four questionnaires. During the first phase, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Simulation Learning Effectiveness Scale (SLES), and Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS) were used after students completed the simulation course in the school simulation laboratory. Nursing students also completed the Holistic Nursing Competence Scale at 2months (Phase 2) and 4months (Phase 3) after clinical practice experience. In Phase 3, students again completed the STAI and SRIS. Partial least squares (PLS), a structural equation modeling (SEM) procedure, was used to test the research model. RESULTS: The findings showed that: (1) at the start of the simulation laboratory, anxiety had a significant negative effect on students' simulation learning effectiveness (SLE; beta=-0.14, p<0.05) and on self-reflection with insight (SRI; beta=-0.52, p<0.01). Self-reflection also had a significant positive effect on simulation learning effectiveness (beta=0.37, p<0.01). Anxiety had a significant negative effect on students' nursing competence during the first 2months of practice in a clinical nursing site (beta=-0.20, p<0.01). Simulation learning effectiveness and self-reflection and insight also had a significant positive effect on nursing competence during the first 2months of practice in a clinical site (beta=0.13; beta=0.16, p<0.05), respectively; and (2) when students practice in a clinical setting, their previous experience of nursing competence during the first 2months of clinical care and their self-reflection and insight have a significant positive effect on their 4-month nursing competence (beta=0.58; beta=0.27, p<0.01). Anxiety, however, had a negative effect on 4-month nursing competence but not significantly. Overall, 41% of the variance in clinical nursing performance was accounted for by the variables in the integrated model. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that self-reflection with insight and clinical experience may help students to deflect anxiety that may influence the development of clinical competence. Of note is that real-life clinical experience has a stronger effect on enhancing clinical performance than does a simulation experience."", ""The impact of nursing curricula on clinical practice anxiety.

OBJECTIVES: There is growing evidence that mindfulness has positive consequences for both psychological and physical health in both clinical and non-clinical populations. The potential benefits of mindfulness underpin a range of therapeutic intervention approaches designed to increase mindfulness in both clinical and community contexts. Self-guided mindfulness-based interventions may be a way to increase access to the benefits of mindfulness. This study explored whether a brief, online, mindfulness-based intervention can increase mindfulness and reduce perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptoms within a student population.

College students participated in a six-week pilot program that consisted of a 60-minute vinyasa flow yoga class once weekly, followed by guided meditation delivered by trained faculty members at the University of Rhode Island College of Pharmacy. Students completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires to evaluate changes in the following outcomes: stress levels, anxiety levels, and mindfulness skills. The questionnaire consisted of three self-reporting tools: the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Students\' scores on each were assessed to detect any changes from baseline using the numerical and categorical scales (low, medium, and high) for each instrument. Results. Seventeen participants, aged 19 to 23 years, completed the study. Thirteen participants were female and four were male. Nine of the students were enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program and eight were enrolled in other academic programs. Students\' anxiety and stress scores decreased significantly while their total mindfulness increased significantly. Changes in categorical data from pre- to post-intervention on the BAI and PSS were significant, with no students scoring in the ""high"" category for stress or anxiety on the post-intervention questionnaire. Conclusion. Students experienced a reduction in stress and anxiety levels after completing a six-week yoga and meditation program preceding final examinations. Results suggest that adopting a mindfulness practice for as little as once per week may reduce stress and anxiety in college students.

This study also examined educational tasks and their association with anxiety in each learning environment. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted using a convenience sample of dental hygiene students enrolled in a two or four year CODA-accredited dental hygiene program in the United States. The Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to determine each participant's anxiety levels in both learning environments. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation, and an analysis of variance. RESULTS: According to the Beck Anxiety Inventory scoring, dental hygiene students experience a moderate level of anxiety when learning in the dental clinic and a low level of anxiety when learning in the classroom. Nervousness was the most reported anxiety symptom in both the dental clinic and the traditional classroom. Test results from the Spearman correlation show that all dental clinic and classroom educational tasks have a significant correlation (p < 0.01) to a student's anxiety level. Anxiety reported by students did not statistically differ by the year in which they were in the dental hygiene program.

The study used a pre-treatment/post-treatment design to assess the effect of the dental procedure on anxiety levels of patients. The Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) was used to measure anxiety levels in patients at pre-treatment. Questions were also asked about factors which may increase (length of the appointment, invasiveness of procedure) or decrease (perceived student interpersonal skills and clinical ability) dental fear. RESULTS: Females reported higher total MDAS scores (M = 11.93) compared to males (M = 9.94). Younger patients (M = 12.15) had higher dental anxiety than older patients (M = 9.34). There was a reduction in dental anxiety from pre-treatment (M = 1.92) to post-treatment (M = 1.23) on the single item anxiety measure though most of the treatment being undergone by patients was for less complex procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' anticipatory experience of anxiety was higher than the anxiety experience after having undergone treatment at the student dental clinic. Student interpersonal skills and clinical ability as perceived by the patient can lessen dental anxiety in patients. Clinical Supervisor-student ratios need to be more equivalent in order to reduce the time length of appointments which currently are associated with increased patient anxiety levels in student dental clinics."", ""Dental Anxiety, Fear and Anxiety of Performing Dental Treatments among Dental Students during Clinical Studies. PURPOSE: Dental student's dental anxiety may negatively affect patient's attitude towards dental treatment. We evaluated dental anxiety among dental students in different clinical stage of their studies. We assessed the student's anxiety prior to treating patients. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Fourth to sixth-year dental students completed questionnaires containing: 1) Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS); 2) Dental Fear Survey (DFS); and 3) visual analogue scale questions relating to the student's anxiety when performing dental treatments in children and adults. RESULTS: 124 dental students completed the questionnaires (mean age, 26.4+/-3.1 years, 59.7% women). Average DAS in the study population was 7.55+/-2.15 with similar scores observed across the years. Average DFS score was highest among fourth-year students (1.62+/-0.65) and lowest among sixth year students (1.36+/-0.32). DFS scores decreased as the students progressed through the clinical years (p=0.059). The students' average anxiety scores prior to treating children were significantly higher than the anxiety scores prior to treating adults (3.82+/-2.42 vs. 2.67+/-1.9, p<0.001). Fifth-year students had significantly higher anxiety scores prior to treating children and adults compared to fourth and sixth-year students. CONCLUSION: Dental anxiety among dental students is relatively low and decreases gradually as they progress through the clinical years. Anxiety prior to treating patients, particularly children, is at its highest just before starting to treat patients for the first time. As dental students are future healthcare providers, it is important that they learn techniques to help them manage their own dental anxiety and fear as well as deal with anxiety related to treating patients.""]",The Impact of Dental Burnout and Anxiety on Patients and Dentists: Insights from a Questionnaire Survey in Dental Clinics

The aim of this paper was to identify the characteristics of broader categories of eating disorders (ED) and help- and care-seeking among college students. An online cross-sectional study was conducted among students of the University of Rouen-Normandy, France. The Expali-validated algorithmic tool, combining SCOFF test (Sick, Control, One stone, Fat, Food) and body mass index, was used to screen eating disorders into three diagnostic categories: restrictive eating disorders, bulimic eating disorders, and hyperphagic eating disorders. A total of 1493 college students were included; mean age was 20.1 years (SD = 1.9). The prevalence of likely cases of eating disorder was 24.8% (95% CI, 22.6-27.0). Percentage distributions of bulimic eating disorders, hyperphagic eating disorders, and restrictive eating disorders were 13.3%, 8.6%, and 2.9%, respectively. The two main resources for help-seeking in emotional stress situations were friends and family, whatever the ED. Students with eating disorders consulted their general practitioner more often for stress or anxiety than students without eating disorders: hyperphagic eating disorders (44.9%), restrictive eating disorders (35.1%), bulimic eating disorders (30.2%), and no eating disorder (20.4%) (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of healthcare renunciation was 21.9%, with a higher risk among students with bulimic eating disorders (AOR CI 95% 1.91 (1.34-2.72).

A qualitative study of college students. Approximately one-third of college students are overweight or obese and the average student gains 5 kg during college. Previous research has identified a relationship between emotional eating and weight gain in young adults, but outside the realm of eating disorders, few studies qualitatively capture why individuals cope with emotions by eating. Exploratory qualitative research was conducted, including 3-day food journals and indepth interviews, with proportionate quota sampling of eight male and eight female undergraduate students to gain an understanding of students' perceptions of their emotional eating behaviors. Participants were purposively selected based on their emotional eating scores on the Weight Related Eating Questionnaire from a larger survey assessing student eating behaviors. Participants' (n=16) mean age was 19.6 +/- 1.0 years and all self-reported their race to be white. Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) for females and males was 24.1 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2) and 24.8 +/- 1.7 kg/m(2), respectively. Findings from the qualitative analyses indicated gender differences and similarities. Females identified stress as the primary trigger for emotional eating, frequently followed by guilt. Males were primarily triggered by unpleasant feelings such as boredom or anxiety turning to food as a distraction; however, males were less likely to experience guilt after an emotional eating episode than females. During emotional eating episodes, both genders chose what they defined as unhealthful foods. These findings indicate a multidisciplinary intervention focusing on emotion and stress management in addition to dietary behavior change should be developed to reduce the potential for weight gain associated with emotional eating in the college-aged population."", 'Students with Food Insecurity Are More Likely to Screen Positive for an Eating Disorder at a Large, Public University in the Midwest. BACKGROUND: College students experience a disproportionately high prevalence of both food insecurity and eating disorders. Food insecurity is associated with stress, irregular eating patterns, weight change, depression, and body dissatisfaction, making it a possible risk factor for the onset of eating disorders. However, the association between food insecurity and eating disorders among college students is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the relation between food insecurity and screening positive for an eating disorder among students attending a large, public Midwestern university. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data were collected using an online survey administered from March through June 2018. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were recruited from a random sample of 2,000 students, with oversampling from the following groups: racial/ethnic minorities, first-generation students, and students from lower-income households. Of those sampled, 851 students (43%) responded. The final analytic sample comprised 804 students after excluding those with missing data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The validated 5-item Sick, Control, One stone, Fat, Food (SCOFF) questionnaire was used to screen for the presence of an eating disorder. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Poisson regression was used to model prevalence ratios for positive SCOFF screens (>/=2 affirmative responses) by levels of food security (ie, high, marginal, low, or very low). Models were adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, degree type, financial aid, and first-generation student status. RESULTS: Compared to students with high food security, a higher prevalence of positive SCOFF screens was found among students with marginal food security (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.83, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.65; P = 0.001), low food security (PR 1.72, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.54; P = 0.007), and very low food security (PR 2.83, 95% CI 2.01 to 3.97; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Students with food insecurity at any level were more likely to screen positive for an eating disorder via the SCOFF questionnaire. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether food insecurity is a risk factor for the onset of eating disorders among college students.']","The Impact of Eating Disorders and BMI on Anxiety, Depression, and Perfectionism Symptoms"

Paramedics commonly experience both poor sleep and mental health symptoms. Clarifying whether sleep or mental health symptoms are a challenge prior to commencement of employment is important, as early prevention and intervention initiatives during training could support these workers. Paramedicine students (n=53) were included, with sleep disorder screening (obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia and restless legs syndrome), and mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms: Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and anxiety symptoms: General Anxiety Disorder-7). Data were analysed using robust regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and shift work status. Meeting criteria for a sleep disorder (n=21) was associated with higher scores for anxiety (8.2 [95% CI: 5.9-10.5] v 4.6, [3.4-5.8]) and depressive symptoms (11.1 [8.6-13.6] v 4.4 [3.1-5.7)] compared to those who did not meet the criteria for a sleep disorder (n=32). Depressive symptoms were lower in those with perceived control over sleep (5.2 [3.2-7.2] v 9.8 [7.7-11.8]). There was no interaction between sleep disorder risk and perceived control over sleep on mental health symptoms. Investigation and management of factors contributing to low perceived control over sleep, together with early screening and management of sleep disorders, are likely to be important priorities to support paramedic student wellbeing prior to commencing shift work.', 'Prevalence and Risk Factors of Poor Sleep Quality in Collegiate Athletes during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lifestyle, sleep and physical activity habits. This study evaluated the prevalence of poor sleep quality, its disrupters, and the impact of the pandemic in collegiate athletes. We performed a cross-sectional study of collegiate athletes (N = 339, median age: 20 (IQR,19-21) years old, 48.5% female, 47% individual sports) who received a web-based questionnaire in April 2021. This survey included subject characteristics, chronotype, sleep disrupters, the changes due to the pandemic and sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]). A multivariate linear regression was performed to assess the relationship between sleep quality, gender, chronotype, sleep disrupters and the changes to training volume or sleep. Results showed a disrupted sleep quality in 63.7%. One in five students had a total sleep time under 6.5 h per night. Poor sleep quality was significantly correlated with nocturnal concerns related to the pandemic, evening chronotype, female gender, third year of study, caffeine consumption and lack of sleep routine (all p < 0.05). To conclude, poor sleep quality is common in collegiate athletes. Sleep disrupters remain prevalent in the lifestyle habits of this population and may have been exacerbated by changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep hygiene should become a major aspect of sports education during the return to post-covid normality.', 'The Impact of a Randomized Sleep Education Intervention for College Students. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep deprivation can impair attention, mood, and performance; however, few effective sleep education programs are available. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a sleep education website, Sleep to Stay Awake (sleeptostayawake.org), on sleep behaviors of college students. METHODS: College students (age 18 years or older) attending a public Midwestern university were randomized to control or intervention groups. All subjects completed baseline surveys that included demographics, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient Health Questionnaire, sleep knowledge, and measures of sleepiness and circadian rhythm. The intervention group then undertook the online intervention. Surveys were repeated at 1 week and at 8 weeks. RESULTS: Students who participated included 295 controls and 254 intervention subjects. The mean age was 21.9 +/- 4.1 years and 41.7% were male. Survey results at 8 weeks showed that more intervention subjects reported improved sleep behaviors (50.3% versus 39.5%, P = .04). Intervention subjects were more likely to stop electronics use earlier (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.5 [1.0-2.4]), keep a more regular sleep schedule (1.6 [1.06-2.4]), have an earlier weekday rise time (2.4 [1.3-4.4]), and have a lower likelihood of insufficient sleep prior to examinations (0.46 [0.28-0.76]). The intervention group had improvement in mean sleep quality (odds ratio = 5.8 versus 6.6, P < .001) and depression scores (odds ratio = 4.6 versus 5.6, P = .03). No significant differences were found in the other measures. CONCLUSIONS: A brief and personalized online sleep education intervention improved sleep behaviors, sleep quality, and depressions scores. This novel approach to address sleep deprivation, poor sleep habits, and mood among college students may offer an effective and inexpensive remedy.']","The Relationship Between Sleep Patterns, Chronotype, and Mental Health Among Students"

AIM: To examine the relationships among the overall person-job match in the six areas of worklife, work-life interference, new nurses' experiences of burnout and intentions to leave their jobs. BACKGROUND: As a large cohort of nurses approaches retirement, it is important to understand the aspects of the nurses work-life that are related to turnover among new graduate nurses to address the nursing workforce shortage. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data collected in a cross-sectional survey of 215 registered nurses working in Ontario acute hospitals was conducted using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: The fit indices suggested a reasonably adequate fit of the data to the hypothesised model [chi(2)  = 247, d.f. = 122, P = 0.001, chi(2) /d.f. = 2.32, Incremental Fit Index (IFI) = 0.954, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.953, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.06]. Person-job match in six areas of worklife had a direct negative effect on burnout (emotional exhaustion and cynicism), which in turn had a direct positive effect on turnover intentions. Work-life interference also influenced turnover intentions indirectly through burnout. CONCLUSION: The study findings demonstrate that new graduate nurses' turnover intentions are a recurring problem, which could be reduced by improving nurses' working conditions. Retention of new graduate nurses could be enhanced by creating supportive working environments to reduce the susceptibility to workplace burnout, and ultimately, lower turnover intentions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Managers must employ strategies to enhance workplace conditions that promote a person-job fit and work-life balance to improve retention of new graduate nurses, and, thereby, lessen the nursing shortage."", ""Starting Out: A time-lagged study of new graduate nurses' transition to practice. BACKGROUND: As the nursing profession ages, new graduate nurses are an invaluable health human resource. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing new graduate nurses' successful transition to their full professional role in Canadian hospital settings and to determine predictors of job and career satisfaction and turnover intentions over a one-year time period in their early employment. DESIGN: A national two-wave survey of new graduate nurses across Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 3906 Registered Nurses with less than 3 years of experience currently working in direct patient care was obtained from the provincial registry databases across Canada. At Time 1, 1020 of 3743 eligible nurses returned completed questionnaires (usable response rate=27.3%). One year later, Time 1 respondents were mailed a follow-up survey; 406 returned a completed questionnaire (response rate=39.8%). METHODS: Surveys containing standardized questionnaires were mailed to participants' home address. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted using SPSS software. RESULTS: Overall, new graduate nurses were positive about their experiences and committed to nursing. However, over half of new nurses in the first year of practice reported high levels of emotional exhaustion and many witnessed or experienced incivility (24-42%) at work. Findings from hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that situational and personal factors explained significant amounts of variance in new graduate nurses' job and career satisfaction and turnover intentions. Cynicism was a significant predictor of all four outcomes one year later, while Psycap predicted job and career satisfaction and career turnover intentions. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide a look into the worklife experiences of Canadian new graduate nurses over a one-year time period and identify factors that influence their job-related outcomes.

AIM: To describe new graduate nurses' worklife experiences in Ontario hospital settings in the first 2 years of practice and to examine predictors of job and career satisfaction and turnover intentions. BACKGROUND: With a large cohort of nurses approaching retirement, every effort must be made to ensure that the work environments of new graduate nurses are positive, promoting job satisfaction and commitment to the profession to address the nursing workforce shortage. METHOD: A cross-sectional analysis of data from a mail survey of new graduate nurses (n=342) in their first and second year of experience was used to address the research objectives. RESULTS: Overall, new graduate nurses were positive about their working conditions and there were few differences between nurses in their first and second years of practice. Structural and personal factors explained significant amounts of variance (31-68%) in both job and career satisfaction and turnover intentions. Empowerment, work engagement and burnout were important significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable workplace factors play an important role in influencing new graduates' job and career satisfaction and turnover intentions.

BACKGROUND: The Internet has many positive sides, but it can also have a negative impact on human emotional-cognitive and behavioral functioning, especially during adolescence. To the most common consequences, the authors add addiction of the teenager to the Internet. This addiction is related to many negative physical and mental problems, including depression, substance abuse and social isolation. METHODS: In the study, SSBS (Student School Burnout Scale) was used to measure the level of burnout, and the level of Internet addiction was measured using PUI (Internet Addiction Test). The research was carried out among 230 individuals aged 17-20 years. RESULTS: The results of the research showed that higher level of school burnout is related to higher Internet addiction indicators, and connection was stronger in the male group. Gender significantly predicted Internet addiction and moderated the link between school burnout and Internet addiction. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses confirmed different predictors of Internet addiction for male and female students. However, for both groups, higher burnout due to parents was a significant predictor of Internet addiction (IA). DISCUSSION: Internet addiction was predicted by school burnout, appearing as a result of parental pressure for high school achievements. In addition, school burnout and school-related characteristics have greater prediction power of Internet addiction and its indicators in a male group.']","The Impact of Internet Addiction on Mental Health: Focus on Facebook, Smartphones, and Gaming"

OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of symptoms of depression among competitive collegiate student athletes and examine the factors associated with symptoms of depression among this population. DESIGN: A baseline survey of a prospective cohort study. SETTING: The survey was administered at the preseason team meetings. PARTICIPANTS: The sample included 257 collegiate student athletes (167 males and 90 females) who participated in Division I National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)-sponsored sports during the 2005-2006 academic year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Symptoms of depression were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD). Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was used to assess the factors associated with symptoms of depression. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent of participants reported experiencing symptoms of depression. Athletes who were female, freshmen, or with self-reported pain were associated with significantly increased odds of experiencing symptoms of depression after adjusting for sports and other covariates. In particular, female athletes had 1.32 greater odds (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.73) of experiencing symptoms of depression compared to male student athletes. Freshmen had 3.27 greater odds (95% CI, 1.63 to 6.59) of experiencing symptoms of depression than their more senior counterparts.

CONTEXT: The effect of athletic participation on lifelong health among elite athletes has received increasing attention, as sport-related injuries can have a substantial influence on long-term health. OBJECTIVE: To determine the current health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of former National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes compared with noncollegiate athletes 5 years after an initial assessment. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Online survey. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: From the former Division I athletes, 193 responses were received (response rate = 83.2%; 128 men, 65 women; age = 58.47 +/- 6.17 years), and from the noncollegiate athletes, 169 surveys were returned (response rate = 75.1%; 80 men, 89 women; age = 58.44 +/- 7.28 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The independent variables were time (baseline, 5 years later) and group (former Division I athlete, noncollegiate athlete). Participants completed 7 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales: sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, physical function, and satisfaction with participation in social roles. RESULTS: Sleep disturbance, depression, fatigue, pain, and physical function were significant for time x group interactions (P values < .05), with the largest differences seen in pain and physical function between groups at time point 2 (22.19 and 13.99 points, respectively). Former Division I athletes had worse scores for depression, fatigue, pain, and physical function at follow-up (P values < .05), with the largest differences seen on the depression, fatigue, and physical function scales (8.33, 6.23, and 6.61 points, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the competitive nature of sport, the long-term risks of diminished HRQoL need to become a priority for health care providers and athletes during their athletic careers. Additionally, physical activity transition programs need to be explored to help senior student-athletes transition from highly structured and competitive collegiate athletics to lifestyle physical activity, as it appears that individuals in the noncollegiate athlete cohort engaged in more physical activity, weighed less, and had increased HRQoL.', 'Anxiety and Depression Prevalence in Incoming Division I Collegiate Athletes From 2017 to 2021.

HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that self-reported levels of anxiety and depression would increase among this population during this timeframe. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3. METHODS: Participants included 792 incoming Division I collegiate athletes. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were completed by all incoming student athletes at a single institution as part of their preparticipation examination over 5 years. Both survey scores were categorized into different levels of severity and separately compared with chi-square tests. Continuous scores were modeled separately using negative binomial regression models including year, sex, sport type, and home location as covariates. RESULTS: Results showed consistent levels of anxiety and depression over time. Female athletes reported higher levels of both anxiety and depression than male athletes, and individual sport athletes reported higher levels of depression than team sport athletes. Distance from home was not associated with anxiety or depression levels. CONCLUSION: Overall, levels of anxiety and depression did not change in this population over this time period.

DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional study followed by a process evaluation. SETTING: Two WIC clinics in a large southeastern U.S. city. PARTICIPANTS: One group (n = 302) included women with infants younger than 12 months who were screened for symptoms of PPD. The second group (n = 31) included case managers (n = 7), nutritionists (n = 12), advisory board members (n = 7), and student volunteers (n = 5) who participated in focus groups. METHODS: We conducted an initial screening of women for symptoms of PPD using the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). Participants with scores of 2 or greater (n = 73) were asked to complete the nine-item PHQ (PHQ-9) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Participants were referred for case management services if they scored 10 or greater on the PHQ-9 or Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (n = 29) and agreed to the referral (n = 19).

BACKGROUND: Maternal beliefs towards COVID-19 vaccine safety may be associated with infant feeding practice and postpartum depression (PPD). Since there is a paucity of studies, this study aims to identify associations of COVID-19-related cognitive factors (e.g., COVID-19-vaccination-related belief and COVID-19-related knowledge and attitude) with infant feeding practices and their associations with PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thai postpartum mothers. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 840 postpartum mothers whose infants were less than or equal to 6 months old. Mothers with a score >/= 13 using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were considered to have PPD. Student t-tests were used to measure the association between infant feeding practices and COVID-19-related cognitive factors, and Chi-square tests were used to assess their associations with PPD. Significant variables (p < 0.05) from the chi-square test were included in the logistic regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with PPD. The associations were reported in adjusted odds ratio at 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: This study showed one-third of the participants (32.4%) were at risk of having PPD. Mothers who fed expressed breastmilk had positive beliefs towards COVID-19 vaccination and higher scores on COVID-19 knowledge and attitude, while mothers who fed infant formula or solid, semi-solid, or soft food had negative beliefs towards the vaccination compared to their counterparts. Multivariable logistic regression showed women who fed their infant with solid, semi-solid, and soft foods (AOR = 3.28; 95% CI = 1.35-10.92) had significantly higher odds of PPD. Among COVID-19-related cognitive factors, negative or moderate COVID-19-related attitudes were associated with higher odds of PPD (1.91; 1.19-3.07 and 1.85; 1.20-2.86, respectively). Socio-demographic factors associated with PPD included living in urban areas, residing outside the Southern region, having food insecurity during the pandemic, having unintended pregnancy, and having health problems during the perinatal period. CONCLUSIONS: The association of COVID-19-related cognitive factors and feeding practices with PPD may suggest that proper education on prevention, control, and vaccination of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19, as well as support for appropriate infant feeding practices, should be provided to postpartum mothers, which ultimately contributes to improving their mental health.', 'Effect of Online 1-Day Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Workshops Plus Usual Care vs Usual Care Alone for Postpartum Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial. IMPORTANCE: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects as many as 20% of mothers, yet just 1 in 10 of these women receives evidence-based treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased PPD risk, reduced treatment access, and shifted preferences toward virtual care. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an online 1-day cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based workshop added to treatment as usual improves PPD, anxiety, social support, mother-infant relationship quality, and infant temperament more than treatment as usual alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial included 403 women with PPD who were recruited across Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 20 to October 4, 2020). Women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of at least 10 who were 18 years or older and had an infant younger than 12 months were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Women were randomly assigned to receive a live, interactive online 1-day CBT-based workshop delivered by a registered psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or clinical psychology graduate student in addition to treatment as usual (n = 202) or to receive treatment as usual and wait-listed to receive the workshop 12 weeks later (n = 201). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in PPD (EPDS scores) in experimental and wait list control groups 12 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes included maternal anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7]), social support (Social Provisions Scale), quality of the mother-infant relationship (Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire), and infant temperament (Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised Very Short Form). RESULTS: Participants all identified as women with a mean (SD) age of 31.8 (4.4) years. The workshop led to significant mean (SD) reductions in EPDS scores (from 16.47 [4.41] to 11.65 [4.83]; B = -4.82; P < .001) and was associated with a higher odds of exhibiting a clinically significant decrease in EPDS scores (odds ratio, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.66-6.46). The mean (SD) GAD-7 scores decreased from 12.41 (5.12) to 7.97 (5.54) after the workshop (B = -4.44; 95% CI, -5.47 to -3.38; P < .001) and participants were more likely to experience a clinically significant change (odds ratio, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.99-4.81). Mothers also reported improvements in bonding (B = -3.22; 95% CI, -4.72 to -1.71; P < .001), infant-focused anxiety (B = -1.64; 95% CI, -2.25 to 1.00; P < .001), social support (B = 3.31; 95% CI, 1.04 to 5.57; P < .001), and positive affectivity/surgency in infants (B = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.56; P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of substance use and mental health problems among veterans and student service members/veterans (SSM/V) returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to New York City's low-income neighborhoods. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 122 veterans attending college and 116 veterans not enrolled recruited using respondent-driven sampling. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis of variation in characteristics of those veterans attending college; linear regression examining effects of college attendance on life satisfaction. RESULTS: Having a traumatic brain injury or disability was positively associated with college attendance. Being married, employed, or in college was predictive of overall life satisfaction. SSM/V were significantly less likely to screen positive for depression or drug use disorder. African American veterans were significantly less likely to attend college than white or Hispanic veterans. CONCLUSION: Substance use and some mental health disorders do not preclude inner-city veterans from entering higher education.

Resilience, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are important factors to consider as student military Veterans work to reintegrate into society. The impact of these factors on academic success is not fully understood, but is important for rehabilitation professionals, student advisors, and counselors. The current study examined the impact of resilience, depression, PTSD, and TBI on student Veteran academic outcomes, and whether the amount of student Veterans' military experience moderated the effect of these factors on academic performance. Seventy-seven student Veterans completed measures that assessed resilience, grade point average, academic disruptions, and symptoms of depression, PTSD, and TBI. Path analysis was used to determine the manner in which the variables influenced academic performance. Results indicate that student Veterans should not be viewed as a homogeneous group and their needs differ based on level of military experience. Academic disruption among less experienced Veterans was most associated with symptoms of depression, whereas academic disruption among more experienced Veterans was most associated with symptoms of TBI.

OBJECTIVE: Millions of disadvantaged youth and returning veterans are enrolled in community colleges. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of mental disorders and help-seeking behaviors among community college students. METHODS: Veterans (n=211) and non-veterans (n=554) were recruited from 11 community colleges and administered screeners for depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), posttraumatic stress disorder (PC-PTSD), non-lethal self-injury, suicide ideation and suicide intent. The survey also asked about the perceived need for, barriers to and utilization of services. Regression analysis was used to compare prevalence between non-veterans and veterans adjusting for non-modifiable factors (age, gender and race/ethnicity). RESULTS: A large proportion of student veterans and non-veterans screened positive and unadjusted bivariate comparisons indicated that student veterans had a significantly higher prevalence of positive depression screens (33.1% versus 19.5%, P<.01), positive PTSD screens (25.7% versus 12.6%, P<.01) and suicide ideation (19.2% versus 10.6%, P=.01). Adjusting for age, gender and race/ethnicity, veterans were significantly more likely than non-veterans to screen positive for depression (OR=2.10, P=.01) and suicide ideation (OR=2.31, P=.03). Student veterans had significantly higher odds of perceiving a need for treatment than non-veterans (OR=1.93, P=.02) but were more likely to perceive stigma (beta=0.28, P=.02). Despite greater need among veterans, there were no significant differences between veterans and non-veterans in use of psychotropic medications, although veterans were more likely to receive psychotherapy (OR=2.35, P=.046). CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the substantial gap between the prevalence of probable mental health disorders and treatment seeking among community college students. Interventions are needed to link community college students to services, especially for student veterans.']",Mental Health and Traumatic Stress Among Veterans and Civilians Exposed to Risk

A three-path model. OBJECTIVE: Many college students may experience mental health problems but do not seek treatment from mental health professionals. The present study examined how perceived stigma and self-stigma toward seeking mental health treatment, as well as perceptions of self-reliance for coping with mental health problems, relate to college student treatment-seeking. METHOD: In total, 246 students completed a self-report survey that included measures of perceived stigma and self-stigma for treatment-seeking, self-reliance for addressing mental health concerns, self-reported mental health problems, symptoms of depression and alcohol-related problems, attitudes toward treatment-seeking, and treatment-seeking behavior. RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that higher perceived stigma, self-stigma, and self-reliance were all related to a more negative attitude toward treatment-seeking. In a 3-path mediation model, bootstrapping results indicated an indirect effect where perceived stigma was related to attitude toward treatment-seeking and treatment-seeking behaviors through self-stigma and self-reliance. Specifically, higher perceived stigma was related to higher self-stigma, higher self-stigma was related to higher self-reliance, and higher self-reliance was associated with a more negative attitude toward treatment-seeking in the overall sample, and a decreased probability of having sought treatment among those who screened positive for a mental health problem. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Perceived stigma may influence whether or not college students seek treatment for mental health problems by potentially increasing stigmatizing attitudes toward themselves and increasing preferences for handling problems on their own. Researchers and practitioners are recommended to seek a better understanding of the complex treatment barriers to reduce stigma and facilitate treatment-seeking.', ""Pharmacy and Medical Students' Mental Health Symptoms, Experiences, Attitudes and Help-Seeking Behaviors. Objective. To examine and compare the prevalence of mental health problems, help-seeking attitudes, and perceptions about mental health problems among US pharmacy and medical students. Methods. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using existing, anonymous survey data collected in the Healthy Minds Study during the 2015-2016 academic year. The analysis included 482 students (159 pharmacy students and 323 medical students) from 23 institutions in the United States. Analyzed topics included demographic characteristics, mental health status and symptoms, substance abuse, stigma related to mental health, help-seeking behaviors and attitudes, and mental health treatment perceptions. Results. Pharmacy and medical students experienced similar rates of depression (18% met clinical cut-offs), but pharmacy students were more likely to meet clinical cutoffs for anxiety (21% vs 11%). Pharmacy students were less likely to seek help from student counseling services (only 11% vs 49%) and also less likely to know where to seek help on campus if needed. Pharmacy students also reported having higher levels of stigma regarding mental health treatment. Conclusion. There are differences between pharmacy and medical students with regards to their experience of mental health symptoms, willingness to seek help, and perception of stigma. Despite the small sample, this analysis of national data indicates that opportunities exist to improve campus-based mental health education and offerings for pharmacy and medical students."", 'Perceived stigma and mental health care seeking. OBJECTIVE: There is limited empirical evidence on the extent to which perceived public stigma prevents individuals from using mental health services, despite substantial recent policy interest in this issue. This study investigated associations between perceived public stigma and mental health care seeking. METHODS: This study used cross-sectional survey data from a representative sample of undergraduate and graduate students (N=2,782) at one university. A five-item scale was used to assess perceived public stigma toward mental health service use. Perceived need for help in the past 12 months and current presence of depressive and anxiety disorders were also assessed. RESULTS: Perceived stigma was higher among males, older students, Asian and Pacific Islanders, international students, students with lower socioeconomic status backgrounds, and students with current mental health problems. Perceived stigma was also higher among those without any family members or friends who had used mental health services and among those who believed that therapy or medication is not very helpful. Perceived stigma was negatively associated with the likelihood of perceiving a need for mental health services, but only among younger students. Among those with probable depressive or anxiety disorders, there was no evidence that perceived stigma was associated with service use. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, at least in this population, perceived stigma may not be as important a barrier to mental health care as the mental health policy discourse currently assumes.']",Mental Attitudes and Illness in Students of Nursing and Pharmacy: Depression and Schizophrenia Disorders

BACKGROUND: Compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue influence nurses' intention to stay or leave nursing. Identification of compassion satisfaction or fatigue in critical care nurses is important in this high turnover workforce. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine factors predicting and contributing to compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue experienced by critical care nurses in Australian intensive care units. METHODS: A self-reported cross-sectional survey using an established tool collected data from critical care nurses of two adult Australian intensive care units. RESULTS: Overall, these critical care nurses reported what Professional Quality of Life Scale guidelines designated as 'average' levels of compassion satisfaction and burnout, and 'low' levels of Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). Compared to Site B, nurses at Site A had significantly higher compassion satisfaction (p=0.008) and lower STS scores (p=0.025), with site significantly predictive for compassion satisfaction (p<0.024) and STS (p<0.002). Nurses with postgraduate qualifications had significantly higher compassion satisfaction scores (p=0.027), and compassion satisfaction significantly increased with increasing duration of practice (p=0.042) as a nurse and in their current ICU (p=0.038). Burnout scores significantly reduced with increasing age, years of tenure and practice; burnout was predicted by lower years of tenure (p<0.016). CONCLUSION: These critical care nurses revealed profiles that, whilst not in crisis, fell short of the ideal high compassion satisfaction and moderate/low fatigue. More recent tenure flags those potentially at higher risk of compassion fatigue, whilst the better scores associated with postgraduate education and from one site need further exploration. Further research should develop understanding and interventions to enhance compassion satisfaction and support retention of this crucial nursing workforce."", 'A pilot study exploring the relationship between self-compassion, self-judgement, self-kindness, compassion, professional quality of life and wellbeing among UK community nurses. BACKGROUND: Compassion fatigue and burnout can impact on performance of nurses. This paper explores the relationship between self-compassion, self-judgement, self-kindness, compassion, professional quality of life, and wellbeing among community nurses. AIM: To measure associations between self-compassion, compassion fatigue, wellbeing, and burnout in community nurses. METHOD: Quantitative data were collected using standardised psychometric questionnaires: (1) Professional Quality of Life Scale; (2) Self-Compassion Scale; (3) short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale; (4) Compassion For Others Scale, used to measure relationships between self-compassion, compassion fatigue, wellbeing, and burnout. PARTICIPANTS: A cross sectional sample of registered community nurses (n=37) studying for a postgraduate diploma at a University in the North of England took part in this study. RESULTS: Results show that community nurses who score high on measures of self-compassion and wellbeing, also report less burnout. Greater compassion satisfaction was also positively associated with compassion for others, and wellbeing, whilst also being negatively correlated with burnout. CONCLUSION: High levels of self-compassion were linked with lower levels of burnout. Furthermore when community nurses have greater compassion satisfaction they also report more compassion for others, increased wellbeing, and less burnout. The implications of this are discussed alongside suggestions for the promotion of greater compassion.', 'Descriptive study of burnout, compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction in undergraduate nursing students at a tertiary education institution in KwaZulu-Natal. BACKGROUND: Studies have investigated burnout and compassion fatigue among nurses and effects in the nursing profession. However, there are limited investigations of burnout and compassion fatigue among undergraduate nursing students in South Africa, as nursing students may experience distressful situations during their nursing education course, which may have an impact during their training and in their profession as they graduate. PURPOSE: The purpose of this descriptive study was to describe compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue and burnout among undergraduate nursing students at a tertiary nursing institution. METHODS: A quantitative descriptive study was conducted to describe compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue and burnout among undergraduate nursing students at a tertiary nursing institution in KwaZulu-Natal. Convenience sampling was used. RESULTS: Sixty-seven undergraduate students (26 third-year and 41 fourth-year nursing students) took the self-test Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). The study results indicate that undergraduate students experienced average levels of compassion fatigue, burnout and compassion satisfaction. CONCLUSION: As shown in the study, some of the undergraduate students are experiencing compassion fatigue and burnout, associated with relieving suffering of others. Therefore, knowledge of compassion fatigue and burnout and the coping strategies should be part of nursing training.']",Occupational burnout fatigue and satisfaction among nursing midwives: A comparative analysis

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of student pharmacist state anxiety on vasopressor calculation accuracy in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) simulations. METHODS: Third-year professional students participated in 2 ACLS-related simulation laboratory sessions. In week 1, students completed 3 calculations at their workstation with no stressors. Students were then randomized into teams for a bedside simulation where they independently completed 3 additional calculations either with or without stressors. Team assignments were maintained for week 2 where all participants completed a high-fidelity ACLS simulation that included a team vasopressor calculation. At both encounters, calculation accuracy was assessed as well as pre- and post-state anxiety using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) survey tool. RESULTS: Students\' (N = 145) trait anxiety aligned with normative data for similarly aged professional students. Post-simulation state anxiety in week 1 was found to be higher for those completing the activity with stressors than without (STAI score 44.7 vs 36.9) paired with lower bedside calculation accuracy, despite similar initial workstation calculation accuracy. In week 2, pre-simulation state anxiety score and calculation accuracy were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, the state anxiety score significantly increased post-simulation for those exposed to stress in the previous week. CONCLUSION: Stress negatively impacted student pharmacist vasopressor calculation accuracy. However, the repeated exposure to a stressed simulation did not result in a significant difference in pre- or post-simulation state anxiety score or calculation accuracy when compared to a non-stressed control. Consideration should be made whether to include more ""real-life"" simulations in student pharmacist education.', ""Psychophysiological fidelity: A comparative study of stress responses to real and simulated clinical emergencies. INTRODUCTION: Experiencing psychological stress may affect clinician performance in acute emergencies. While simulation is used extensively in healthcare education, it is unknown whether simulation effectively replicates the psychophysiological stress of real-world conditions. Thus, this study explored whether measurable differences exist in psychophysiological responses to acute stress in simulated compared with real-world clinical practice. METHODS: In this within-subjects observational study, stress appraisals, state anxiety and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded during simulated and real-world emergencies in a 6-month training placement in neonatal medicine. Eleven postgraduate trainees and one advanced neonatal nurse practitioner participated. Mean (SD) participant age was 33 (8) years; and eight participants (67%) were female. Data were collected at rest and immediately before, during and 20 min after simulated and real-world neonatal emergencies. In situ simulation scenarios were modelled on those used in accredited neonatal basic life support training. Stress appraisals and state anxiety were assessed using Demand Resource Evaluation Scores and the short State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. High-frequency power, a component of HRV associated with parasympathetic tone, was derived from electrocardiogram recordings. RESULTS: Simulation was associated with greater likelihood of threat appraisal and higher state anxiety. High-frequency HRV reduced from baseline in simulated and real-world emergencies but recovered further towards baseline 20 min after simulated events. Possible explanations for the observed differences between conditions include participants' previous experiences and expectations of simulation and the effect of post-simulation debrief and feedback. DISCUSSION: This study identifies important differences in psychophysiological stress responses to simulated and real-world emergencies. Threat appraisals, state anxiety and parasympathetic withdrawal are educationally and clinically significant, given their known associations with performance, social functioning and health regulation. While simulation may facilitate interventions aimed at optimising clinicians' stress responses, it is vital to confirm that outcomes transfer to real-world clinical practice."", ""Factors associated with medical student test anxiety in objective structured clinical examinations: a preliminary study. OBJECTIVES: To investigate attributes of medical students associated with their test anxiety on Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted of all Year 3 and 4 students at a private medical school in South Korea in 2014. This 53-item questionnaire consisted of factors pertaining to test anxiety on the OSCE identified from a review of relevant literature, which included students' motivational beliefs and achievement emotions, perceived values of the OSCE, and attitude and orientation towards patients. Participants' test anxiety levels were measured using the Korean Achievement Emotions Questionnaire. Participants rated their responses using a five-point Likert-type scale. Univariate analysis was performed to examine relationships between the variables. RESULTS: A total of 94 students completed the questionnaire (a 93% response rate). No differences in the participants' test anxiety scores were observed across genders, entry-levels, or years in medical school. Participants' test anxiety on the OSCE showed moderate association with their class-related achievement emotions (i.e., anxiety and boredom), where r = 0.46 and 0.32, p < 0.01, respectively, and weak negative associations with their patient-centeredness (r = -0.21, p < 0.05) and with their perceived values of the OSCE (r = -0.21, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study found some non-cognitive factors related to medical students' test anxiety on the OSCE. These findings have implications for developing effective educational interventions for helping students cope with such a stress by enhancing our understanding of the various factors that influence their test anxiety in OSCEs.""]",Simulated Testing and Stress Analysis in Exam Training for Students
